Sampling
========
This package is composed by functions and utilities to perform spatial
subsamples of the spatial data.
It is specially use for performing CV for ML techniques and for testing
the out-of-sample performance of the applied methods.
It could be used to study the stability of your methods in the problem of
facing unknown data in the neighbourhood.

There are different sampling types:
-----------------------------------
- Sampling from a collection of points.
- Sampling from the space.
-----------------------------------
- Uniform sampling.
- Weighted sampling.
-----------------------------------
- Grouped sampling
- Disperse sampling
-----------------------------------
- Fixed number of samples
- Non-fixed samples
